# üê™ The Camelculator üê™
### Camel (C)up Calculator

The Camelculator is an assistant tool to go with the board game Camel Up to determine the odds of camels winning and the value of the betting tiles based on the current board state.

Currently the only way to use the Camelculator is to enter in the current board state and dice state using Camel Code. Squares on the board are separated by a comma (",") going to the goal from left to right. Camels stack within a square with the rightmost camel on the top. Here is an example of Camel Code where yellow is winning `rw,,o,gby`. The dice state needs the remaining dice that have not been rolled. Each round would start something like this `rwgby`.
